# Smarty-Bird  
An extension of my previous Flappy Bird. In this version, the Birds will learn to play the game via a neural network trained by a genetic algorithm.  
A few keyboard control options while running:  
- ESCAPE = quit game  
- UP = double simulation speed  
- DOWN = halfen simulation speed  
- RIGHT = increase simulation speed to max capacity  
- LEFT = return to normal simulation speed  
- K = kill current generation and start breeding the next one using current fitness
